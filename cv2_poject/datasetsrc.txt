Ant detection model 

- extreme small object detectionmodel 
Need a dataset with ants and different kinds of ants
- ants are mostly black so we can convert the images to black and white for reduce the size
- ants are similar in shape so we can also draw some borders on edges and then convert the image to 2d  less in size 

- ants are mostly on group and near the group so color of the ground is  dark also  
And the grass is ilso a big noise in the dataset
